AuthMiddleware:
--------------------------
This middleware function is crucial for protecting private routes in your application. It ensures that only requests with a valid JWT (JSON Web Token) can access certain endpoints.

The JWT is expected to be sent as a cookie named auth-token. If the token is present and valid, it allows the request to proceed; otherwise, it blocks the request by sending an appropriate error response.

This is important for security because it ensures that only authenticated users can access certain resources or perform certain actions.

AuthMiddleware (Node.js Middleware):
-------------------------------------------------
This is a function in a Node.js server that checks if the user trying to access a certain part of your application has a valid token (a kind of digital pass).
If the token isn't there or is invalid, it stops the user and sends back a message saying access is denied. This helps to protect private parts of your app.

Login Function:
-------------------------

Login, Register, Logout Functions:
-----------------------------------------
Login: Checks if the user's email and password match what's stored in the database. If they do, it logs the user in and sends a token as a cookie.
Register: Allows a new user to create an account, securely saving their password and personal information.
Logout: Logs the user out by clearing the token, effectively ending the session.
JWT (JSON Web Tokens):
----------------------------------
This is a secure way to handle authentication by issuing a token when a user logs in. The token is checked every time a request is made to ensure it's a valid request by the logged-in user.
This function handles the user login process. It checks if the user exists in the database and whether the provided password matches the stored hash.

If authentication is successful, it creates a JWT that includes the user's ID and sends it back to the client as a cookie. This token is used for subsequent requests to authenticate the user.

JWT and cookies are used here to manage sessions securely, especially since HTTP is stateless.

Logout Function:
--------------------------
This function "logs out" a user by clearing the authentication cookie. It sets the cookie with an immediate expiration date, effectively removing it from the client's browser.
This is important for user security, especially on shared devices.

AuthContext and AuthProvider (React Context):
-------------------------------------------------------
These are used in the React frontend part of your app.
AuthContext is like a global storage that holds information about the user who is logged in.
AuthProvider is a component that provides the user information to other parts of your app, making it easy to check anywhere in your app if the user is logged in and who they are.

useAuthContext (React Hook):
----------------------------------
This is a custom hook in React that makes it easy to grab and use the user information stored in AuthContext wherever you need it in your app.
//.populate("products.product"): This part fills in additional details about each product in the cart. Normally, the cart might only store product IDs to save space. With populate(), it fetches each product's full data (like name, price, etc.) from the product's collection in the database. This is useful because it allows you to get all necessary product information.

//Cart.findOne({ user: req.userId }): This line searches the database for a shopping cart that belongs to the current user. The req.userId is assumed to be the ID of the user who is logged in and making the request.

//When you call .populate("products.product"), you're instructing Mongoose to go through each item in the products array of the Cart document, look at the product field (which contains an ID), and replace this ID with the actual document from the Product collection that corresponds to the ID.
